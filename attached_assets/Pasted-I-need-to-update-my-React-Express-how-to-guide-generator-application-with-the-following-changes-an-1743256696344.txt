I need to update my React + Express how‑to guide generator application with the following changes and optimizations to make it production‑ready on Netlify:

1. UI & Layout Adjustments
Remove "Powered by Anthropic Claude AI":
Remove any branding or attribution text that currently states "Powered by Anthropic Claude AI" from the UI.

Header & Branding:

Display the "HowTo.AI" logo on the left in white text, with the slogan "Experts guide, Instantly" right below it.

Ensure the header is clean, minimalist, and SEO optimized.

Input & Ad Container Positioning:

Before Guide Generation:

Place a clear user input text box (white textbox on a predominantly black background, with blue accent elements for buttons/links) centered on the page.

Directly below the text box, add a container holding three ad slots. These ads should be visible while the user is entering their prompt and waiting for the guide to generate.

After Guide Generation:

Once the guide is generated, display the guide in the main content area.

The original ad container should then shift to the right side as a fixed/sticky sidebar that remains visible alongside the content.

Additionally, include inline ad units within the generated guide content (e.g., after key sections or paragraphs) and a full-width ad container at the bottom of the guide.

Reposition Popular Guide Section:

Move any “Popular Guide” or similar featured content section further down the page (below the main generated guide) to ensure the primary focus is on user-generated content and ads are intelligently positioned.

2. Functionality & Features
Core Features:

Accept a user’s prompt to generate a personalized how‑to guide via the Anthropic API.

Once the guide is generated, allow the user to share, print, and download the guide as a PDF.

Ensure the PDF generation feature is robust (using jsPDF or a server‑side PDF generator).

Ad Integration:

Initial Ads: The three-ad container should be visible immediately under the input box during query submission.

Post-Generation Layout: After the guide is generated:

The ad container moves to a right‑side column (sticky sidebar) that extends to the end of the guide.

Insert inline ads within the guide content at strategic breaks to maximize viewability without interfering with content readability.

Include a dedicated ad container at the bottom of the guide.

Use a premium ad network (e.g., Mediavine or another high‑RPM alternative to AdSense) for monetization.

3. SEO & Performance Enhancements
SEO Optimizations:

Use semantic HTML5 elements (header, main, footer, article, section, etc.) throughout the application.

Add meta tags (title, description, viewport, keywords) and structured data (JSON‑LD for articles/guides).

Ensure all images have descriptive alt attributes and that internal links are properly structured.

Optimize page load times by minifying assets (CSS/JS) and using efficient caching.

Responsive Design:

The layout must adapt gracefully to mobile devices by reverting to a single‑column layout where the ad sidebar becomes an in‑content or bottom‑placed ad container.

4. Deployment Readiness for Netlify
Production Build Configuration:

Update the React app to run in production mode (disable development warnings, enable minification, etc.).

Ensure environment variables (e.g., API keys, NODE_ENV) are correctly configured for production.

Configure the Express API (or serverless functions, if converting to Netlify Functions) to work over HTTPS with proper CORS settings.

Create an optimized build script and deploy the final bundle to Netlify.

Testing & Documentation:

Provide detailed inline comments and documentation.

Include a flow diagram of the updated UI layout and ad placements.

Run end-to-end tests to ensure that all functionalities (input, guide generation, ad shifting, share/print/download features) work as expected.

5. Additional Requirements
Consistency & Style Guide:

Follow a consistent code style (e.g., Airbnb’s React style guide) for both frontend and backend code.

Include clear, modular component structures for the UI and separate modules for API integration, PDF generation, and ad management.

Error Handling:

Improve error handling for JSON parsing and API calls on the Express side (using try/catch blocks with fallback content in case of malformed API responses).

Remove any nested <a> elements or other DOM nesting issues causing React warnings.

Please update the code according to the above instructions. The goal is to have a clean, production‑ready SPA with an optimal user experience, intelligent ad placements, robust PDF/download/share functionalities, and full SEO optimization for deployment on Netlify.

This should resolve existing errors, update the UI layout per the new requirements, and ensure the application is deployment‑ready.
