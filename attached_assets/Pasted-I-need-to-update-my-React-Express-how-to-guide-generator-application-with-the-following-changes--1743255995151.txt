I need to update my React + Express how-to guide generator application with the following changes:

Resolve React & JSON Errors:

DOM Nesting Warning:

The error Warning: validateDOMNesting(...): <a> cannot appear as a descendant of <a>. indicates that there are nested <a> elements in my React components.

Please review the component structure (likely in components that render links) and refactor them to ensure that no <a> element is nested inside another <a>.

JSON Parsing Error in Express Route:

The server is throwing syntax errors when parsing the JSON from the AI API response (e.g., "Expected ',' or ']' after array element").

Add robust error handling and validation for the JSON response in /server/routes.ts at the appropriate lines. Use a try/catch block, and if parsing fails, apply additional cleanup or use fallback content.

Log the error details to help diagnose malformed responses.

Production-Readiness for Netlify Deployment:

Update the build configuration for React and Express to use production settings:

For the React app: Ensure that all development warnings are removed (e.g., disable React DevTools warnings) and that code is minified.

Create an optimized build script (e.g., using Vite or Create React App’s production build command).

In Express, set NODE_ENV=production and ensure error messages are not leaked.

Adjust environment variables to work on Netlify (or Netlify Functions for the Express API).

Ensure that the API endpoints are served over HTTPS and that CORS is properly configured for production.

Revise the Layout for the How-To Application:

Desired Layout Concept:

Use a minimalistic, responsive design that’s proven effective for content-driven applications.

Header:

Display the "HowTo.AI" logo (white text on the left) with the slogan "Experts guide, Instantly" below it.

Main Section:

A clear input area for the user query with a white text box on a black background (with blue accents for buttons/links).

Once the guide is generated, display it in a full-width main content area.

Ad Placement:

Instead of having a static ad container that moves, adopt a layout that uses a fixed sidebar for ads on larger screens.

On mobile, ads should appear either above or below the generated content without interrupting the user experience.

Use a proven layout pattern such as a two-column layout where the left column holds the content and the right column (fixed or sticky) displays ads. On smaller screens, revert to a single column with ads at the bottom.

Footer/Action Buttons:

Include buttons for Share, Print, and Download PDF (integrate PDF generation functionality using a library like jsPDF or a server-side solution).

Additional Instructions:

Use best practices for SEO (semantic HTML5, meta tags, alt attributes, and structured data).

Ensure all code is well-commented and follows a consistent style guide (e.g., Airbnb's React style guide).

Provide clear instructions or a flow diagram illustrating the new layout structure.

Validate that the application is fully functional end-to-end after the fixes and layout changes.

Please update the code accordingly and ensure that all errors are resolved, the layout is modern and effective for a how‑to guide with intelligent ad placement, and that the project is production-ready for deployment on Netlify.
